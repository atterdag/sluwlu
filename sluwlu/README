sluwlu.pl (Sync-Local-Users-With-LDAP-Users) will compare a system local
users and groups with the users and groups in a LDAP DIT.


THE SLUWLU.PL SCRIPT:
---------------------

User, groups, UIDs and GIDs:
----------------------------
If UID/GID og a local-only user or group is conflicting with a LDAP user and
group, it will find a new unused UID or GID for the user or group.

If a local user or group exists also in the LDAP user, the script will change
the UID/GID of the local user to the UID/GID of the LDAP user or group.

It will then generate a passwd.new and group.new with the new UIDs and GIDs.

File and directory ownerships:
------------------------------
It will then generate a scripts, chown.sh, that modifies the ownership of the files
belonging to the UIDs and GIDs of changed users and groups.

E.g. if the local user 'jdoe' had his UID changed from 1002 to 1003, then for
instance all his files under /home/jdoe would belong to someone else after
you have exchanged /etc/passwd with the new passwd. But the chown.sh script
contains a 'chown' command for each file, that 'belonged' to the old UID of
jdoe. And running the chown.sh script will the change back ownership to jdoe
of all the files that belonged to the old UID of jdoe.

A run script:
-------------
Finally sluwlu.pl generates a run script, run.sh.

THE RUN.SH SCRIPT:
------------------
This script will move passwd.new and group.new to /etc/passwd and /etc/group
respectively. And it will backup the old versions first of course.
Afterwards it will run the chown.sh script.
