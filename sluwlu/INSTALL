Send the system to runlevel 1. Make sure all daemons are dead and only the 
neccessary programs are running. Start up your network interface so that you 
can communicate with your LDAP server. Then verify that passwd.new, 
group.new, chown.sh and chgrp.sh contains the information that you would 
expect. And finally run:

	# ./run.sh.

Thats it! Now restart your box.
